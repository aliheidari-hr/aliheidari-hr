## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
My familiarity with programming started in university with C++ and Java languages. Little by little, I got interested in web development, especially front-end development. So, I started learning HTML and CSS and tried to challenge and improve my skills by doing creative projects.
In the next step, I started learning JavaScript, which was very interesting to me, and I tried to understand it deeply. Right now, I'm focused on learning React.js.
